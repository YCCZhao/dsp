[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using CohenEffectSzie to calculate effect size: 
                                   
```python             
d_weight = CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
d_length = CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth)
```

I got Cohen's d of -0.08, it means that first babies are ligther than other. On the other hand I got Cohen's d of 0.029 when comparing preganacy length. Pregnancy length is longer for first babies than other babies, but effect size of the difference is bigger in terms of weight.
